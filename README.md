# rock-paper-scissors-project

A simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors” game.

You can check them game in console, there is no UI yet, it should be added in the future. For now it is just a basic game where player picks what's he gonna play in prompt window, and computer choice is randomized. The game also keeps score and declares a winner after 5 rounds.
