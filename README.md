# rock-paper-scissors-project

A simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors” game.

You can check them game in console, there is no UI yet, it should be added in the future. For now it is just a basic game where player picks what's he gonna play in prompt window, and computer choice is randomized. The game also keeps score and declares a winner after 5 rounds.

With the latest update the game has UI, and shows everything on a webpage. There are now buttons where player can click to pick rock/paper/scissors, computer choices are still randomized. The winner is whoever gets to 5 points first, and it is displayed on a page. "Play Again" button was added so player can play the game again.
